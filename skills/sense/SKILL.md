name: sense
description: Query a markdown tree with the sense CLI — filter notes by frontmatter, full-text search the prose, follow wikilinks/backlinks, and read note outlines. Use when the user wants to query, filter, count, search, or report on a folder of markdown notes, when you need to find which notes discuss a topic before reading them, when you want a note's backlinks or structure, when a directory has a sense.config.json, or when asked to add a named query to one.

# sense

SQL over a markdown tree, kept fresh by a filesystem check on every query. Four tables per file:
`frontmatter` (one column per key, plus `path`/`_mtime`/`_size`/`_rank`), `content` (FTS5:
`title`, `summary`, `text`), `links` (`src`, `target`, `dst` — `NULL` dst = dead link),
`sections` (heading outline with line ranges and token estimates).

## What each tool is for

Every result is a reference (path, metadata, excerpt), never file contents; prose enters
context only when you Read it. Costs: `map` is fixed-size, a `find` row ~30 tokens, `peek`
~17% of reading the file. Which tool fits is a property of the question:

- A deterministic, factual answer over known fields — counts, filters, "which notes have
  X" — is SQL: `sense query`, a named query, or `find --where`. Enumerates every match;
  same result regardless of phrasing.
- Locating notes by words in their prose is `find` — ranked lexical match. Results shift as
  phrasing shifts, and bare words AND-join (one absent word = zero rows): write
  `a OR b OR c` for any-word matching.
- A conceptual question the notes phrase in different words is `find --semantic` (exists only
  on trees whose config enables `embed`): adds meaning-based candidates labeled `via: vector`.
  Conceptual similarity, not typo-tolerance; false positives are expected, labeled, and
  bounded by `--k`.
- `map` answers "what is this tree" — fields, hub notes, recent changes — when the tree is
  unfamiliar.
- `peek <path>` prices a file before you pay for it: outline with `[L143-162, ~380t]`
  ranges, links both ways.
- When you know the file and need its contents, `Read` it — sense adds nothing there. On
  large files peek's ranges let you read just one section; small files are often cheaper
  whole.

Output defaults to a table, built for humans; `--format json` returns the same rows
machine-parseable.

## Verbs

```
sense find "pricing OR billing OR invoicing" --where "f.status = 'active'" --k 10
sense peek notes/pricing-model.md               # a unique basename also works
sense map
sense query "<sql>" [params...]                 # ad-hoc SQL; ? binds positional args, count-checked
sense <name> [params...]                        # named query from sense.config.json
sense --list | status | rebuild | check
```

- Terms pass verbatim to FTS5 MATCH. Bare words AND-join — one absent word means zero rows —
  so write `OR` yourself when you want any-word matching; double-quote punctuated terms
  (`"customer-facing"`, `"founder's"`); invalid syntax is an error, not a rewrite. The same
  rules apply to search commands you write into subagent briefs.
- When a search misses, the recall levers are: OR-in synonyms and concrete instances (the
  index only knows the words in the files — a note about a specific tool rarely names its
  category), raise `--k` (a row costs ~30 tokens), and on embed-enabled trees `--semantic`
  (matches meaning where term overlap fails). Each widening adds candidates and dilutes
  ranking, so the noise trade-off runs both ways.
- A frontmatter query enumerates its matches deterministically; search ranks by term overlap,
  so results shift as phrasing shifts. Trade-off: a query needs a known field, search doesn't.
- `find` fuses BM25 with link-graph expansion; the `via` column says what produced each row —
  `match` (terms hit), `link` (connected to notes that hit), `match+link` (both). With
  `--semantic`, `vector` joins the composition and rows gain a `lines` column pointing at the
  best-matching section, a direct `Read` range.
- `--where` takes any SQL condition against frontmatter alias `f` — not only field equality:
  `"f.status = 'active' AND has(f.tags, 'x')"`, `"f.path NOT LIKE 'generated/%'"`,
  `"f.created >= datetime(?)"`. A tree can declare a default scope in `sense.config.json`
  (`defaults.find.where`); an explicit `--where` replaces it, so `--where "1=1"` searches
  everything. `sense status` prints the active default.
- `score` is a rank-fusion value: it ranks rows within one result set and is not comparable
  across queries, not a relevance magnitude — a perfect lexical hit and a weak vector-only
  hit can both read ~0.017, because the number encodes how many signals fired and at what
  rank. With `--semantic`, rows carry `similarity` (cosine, -1 to 1) which does measure
  match quality: on a query whose words are absent from the tree, similarities sit near zero
  (and can be negative), while a genuine paraphrase match runs high.
- Lexical `find` returns 0 rows when nothing matches, so it answers "is this in the tree at
  all". `--semantic` always returns up to `k` rows — nearest-neighbour search has a nearest
  neighbour for any input — so absence is a lexical question; with `--semantic` the
  `similarity` column is what separates a real hit from the best of a bad lot.
- `sense check` prepares every saved query (catching syntax and unknown-column errors), runs
  the ones taking no parameters, and prints row counts: a saved query returning 0 rows looks
  the same as a true empty result until something distinguishes them.

## SQL

The verbs are shorthands over the same four tables; anything they don't express, SQL does.

```
sense query "SELECT name FROM pragma_table_info('frontmatter')"          # what fields exist
sense query "SELECT DISTINCT status FROM frontmatter"                    # what values a field takes
sense query "SELECT src FROM links WHERE dst = ?" notes/pricing-model.md  # backlinks
sense query "SELECT src, target FROM links WHERE dst IS NULL"            # dead links
sense query "SELECT path FROM frontmatter WHERE path NOT IN (SELECT dst FROM links WHERE dst IS NOT NULL)"  # orphans
sense query "SELECT heading, start_line, tokens FROM sections WHERE path = ?" a.md   # budget a read
sense query "SELECT j.value, COUNT(*) n FROM frontmatter, json_each(frontmatter.tags) j GROUP BY j.value ORDER BY n DESC"   # count per array member
```

- `content MATCH` takes FTS5 syntax: `a OR b`, `"phrase"`, `pref*`, `NEAR(a b, 5)`,
  `summary: term`. Stemmed; markdown stripped at index time. Double-quote any term with
  punctuation — bare `customer-facing` errors (`-` reads as a column filter), bare
  apostrophes are syntax errors: write `"customer-facing"`, `"founder's"`.
- Rank with `ORDER BY bm25(content, 10.0, 5.0, 1.0)` (title > summary > body); excerpt with
  `snippet(content, -1, '«', '»', '…', 10)`.
- Select `content.title`/`content.summary` (always exist, empty when absent) rather than
  `f.title`/`f.summary` (discovered columns — error on trees that never declare them).
- Frontmatter values keep their YAML type: strings are TEXT, whole numbers and booleans are
  INTEGER (`true` stores as 1, so `WHERE flag = 1` matches and `WHERE flag = 'true'` matches
  nothing), fractions are REAL, lists and maps are JSON text. `map` prints the observed type
  per field, and a field showing two types (`integer,text`) has drifted across notes.
- `has(field, value)`: array membership on JSON-array fields, substring on strings, false on NULL
  — the `includes()` convention. Substring means `has(f.status, 'active')` also matches
  `inactive`; exact scalar match is `f.status = ?`, deliberate substring is `LIKE`, exact array
  membership is `EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM json_each(f.tags) WHERE value = ?)`.
  To aggregate per member instead, use `json_each(frontmatter.<field>)` (above) -- GROUP BY on the
  raw column splits `["a","b"]` and `["b","a"]` into separate buckets.
- Date fields are stored as written. Compare through `datetime()`, which normalizes ISO 8601
  timezone offsets to UTC: `WHERE datetime(created) >= datetime(?)`. Bare string comparison
  is only safe when every note uses the same offset.
- To bound what a query puts into context: `snippet()` excerpts just the matching text,
  `LIMIT` caps row counts, and selecting `path`/`title`/`summary` keeps rows small.
  `SELECT text FROM content` returns the tree's entire prose (sense warns past 50 KB).
  Aggregates (`COUNT`, `GROUP BY`) are already bounded. `SELECT * FROM frontmatter` is always
  safe — prose is not a frontmatter column.

## Setup and upkeep

- Missing CLI: `npm install -g sensemaking`. Missing config: `sense init` at the tree root.
  Discovery walks up from cwd; `--config <path>` overrides. Setting up or restructuring a
  tree (features, frontmatter conventions, note design) is the `sense-setup` skill.
- `map` and `status` report feature state (`features: links, sections, rank · off: embed
  (features.embed)`). Invoking a capability whose feature is off is an error naming the
  config key to enable — nothing silently falls back.
- Save a query into `sense.config.json` only when it will be reused; run ad-hoc otherwise.
- A one-line `summary:` per note is optional and pays twice: it appears in result rows and is a
  weighted search field. Date comparisons work for dates written as ISO 8601 (`2026-08-12`, or
  with time and offset) — the only format `datetime()` parses. Field names in examples
  (`status`, `tags`, `created`) are illustrative; your tree defines its own.
- Reserved frontmatter keys (dropped with a warning): `path`, `_mtime`, `_size`, `_rank`,
  `content`, `links`, `sections`.
- Exit codes: `0` ok, `1` error (SQLite message verbatim), `2` usage (unknown query, wrong
  param count).
- Doubted cache: `sense rebuild`. Rarely needed — every query reconciles first.
